//The test demonstrates one of the temptations a developer meets when writing tests.
//
// What we have here is actually 3 tests, but layed out as a single function with 3 asserts.
//
// Sometimes it’s easier to write this way, but if an error occurs, it’s much less obvious what went wrong.
//
// If an error happens in the middle of a complex execution flow, then we’ll have to figure out the data at that point. We’ll actually have to debug the test.
//
// It would be much better to break the test into multiple it blocks with clearly written inputs and outputs.
//
// Like this:
